        <p>Stories are an integral part of every human being. We thrive on them.
        Furthermore, in this day and age — the stories we encounter can reflect
        as much upon us as we upon them.</p>

        <p>This paper explores how we might ascertain the significance of
            interactivity and choice in narratives for generating long-lasting
            impressions on consumers. How and when do stories become significant?
            Furthermore, what might be the distinction between having “choices that
            <em>feel</em> significant” versus “choices that <em>are</em>
            significant” in interactive narratives.</p>
            <p>To understand these questions, we must first think about the basic
            building blocks for meaningful outcomes in narratives. As such, we will
            consider the following elements of narratives: • Emotional investment in
            the characters and storyworld, • The role of Causality and
            “Fill-in-the-blank” storytelling in generating said emotional
            investment, and • Realistic characters with flaws, and how they deal
            with that.</p>
            <h1 id="analysis"><strong>Analysis:</strong></h1>
            <p>What makes video games an effective medium for delivering narratives
            capable of leaving players with long-lasting impressions? To understand
            this, we must break down our problem: We must first understand what
            makes video games an effective medium.</p>
            <p>An element of this is understanding the distinction between
            <em><strong>old media narratives</strong></em> and <em><strong>new media
            narratives</strong></em> and the dance between “<strong>Play</strong>”
            and “<strong>Narrative</strong>.” Expanding on this, we establish the
            context that: here, the term “<em>old media narratives”</em> refers to
            <em>traditional narrative media</em> such as books, theatre, movies;
            and, the term “<em>new media narratives”</em> refers to more recent
            kinds of media, such as but not limited to, hypertext adventures, video
            games, VR &amp; AR.</p>
            <p>What <em><strong>new media narratives</strong></em> hold over
            <strong><em>old media narratives</em></strong> is the capacity to
            generate <strong><u>emergent narrative</u></strong> — that is to say,
            they allow the player/consumer to create their own stories through
            interaction &amp; play. This often includes choice and agency, which is
            compounded by the fact that new media narratives are never purely
            composed of emergent narrative only — they are an amalgamation of both
            traditional and emergent narrative. This permits new media narratives
            the potential to have an effect more significant than the sum of its
            parts.</p>

            interactive visual medium — complex electronic game’ that suggests, if
            not an evolution or teleology, at least a discernible trend towards the
            possibility of ever greater orchestrations of Future Narratives and of
            an increase of what we have come to call ‘nodal power,’ that is, the
            degree of openness that any nodal situation offers” (Bode 8;
            Preface).</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Thus, we may assess that new media narratives exist on a spectrum.
            One end: offering narrative exclusively through traditional means: being
            comprised entirely of pre-defined text — in essence, a traditional
            narrative, and, on the other end: offering narrative exclusively through
            emergent means: i.e., A Pen-and-Paper RPG, where only the setting and
            the rules are predefined, and all subsequent story is purely emergent
            through play.</p>
            <p>A reasonable assumption to be made is that the medium of video games
            exists somewhat as a middle-ground between the two ends of the spectrum.
            At its core, every video game comprises two defining elements —
            “<em><strong>The Mechanics</strong></em>” and the
            “<em><strong>Story</strong></em>.” The “mechanics” signify the
            <em><strong>rules governing interactivity,</strong></em> and the “story”
            signifies the video game’s fiction. As such, emergent narratives deliver
            meaningful experiences through the establishment of either</p>
            <p>(a) <em><strong>A Sense of Authorship</strong></em>, or</p>
            <p>(b) <em><strong>A Sense of Emotional Connection.</strong></em></p>
            <p>For example: In Minecraft, the act of building invokes a sense of
            authorship within the player. Alternatively, games with a systemic
            design — where each of the game’s individual systems influences the
            emergent gameplay, along with aspects of RNG (<em>Random Number
            Generation</em>) — have the potential to bring about memorable moments
            through instances of real emotional effect, such as through fun and
            laughter, frustration and rage, or anything in between. Think
            “<em><strong>Far Cry 4</strong></em>” (Ubisoft, 2014),
            “<em><strong>Subnautica</strong></em>” (Unknown Worlds Entertainment,
            Gearbox Interactive. 2014), or “<em><strong>Hades</strong></em>”
            (Supergiant games, 2020).</p>
            <p>Ultimately, a large part of imparting memorable experiences onto
            players comes from the game narrative being able to retain the player’s
            engagement long enough to deliver its contents.</p>
            <p>In their book “Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and
            Fictional Worlds,” author Jasper Juul points out that
            “<em><strong>[r]ules and fiction compete for the player’s
            attention</strong>. They are complementary, but not symmetrical: [...]
            Though rules can function independent of fiction, fiction depends on
            rules. [...] <strong>[R]ules are designed to be objective, obligatory,
            unambiguous</strong>, and generally above discussion. With fiction in
            games, we find the opposite to be true: a strong part of the attraction
            of <strong>fiction in games is that it is highly subjective, optional,
            ambiguous, and generally evocative and subject to discussion</strong>.
            Rules and fiction are attractive for opposite reasons</em>” (121; Ch.
            4). The author of the book “Storyplaying: Agency and Narrative in Video
            Games,” Sebastian Domsch, refutes this notion as incomplete. They
            suggest that Juul’s statements neglect the possibility of a video game’s
            rules connected to the game’s fiction (151; Ch. 6). This paper proposes
            an interpolation of these two views: the rules and the fiction of a game
            lie on a spectrum, rather than be rigidly defined in one way or another.
            The two elements are fluid so far as these elements happen to “rise
            above” to fill the demand posed by their complement — the real potential
            for storytelling arising when the two elements exist in equilibrium.</p>
            <p>Game designer Jurie Horneman, in their 2015 GDC session on “The
            Design in Narrative Design,” comments on how an imbalance between the
            contributions of the mechanics and the fiction within a video game can
            cause dissonance, which risks breaking the player’s suspension of
            disbelief. Furthermore, Horrneman defines the term
            “<strong>diegesis</strong>” as the situation wherein a game can justify
            its mechanical elements within the game’s fiction, bringing about a
            balance.</p>
            <h2 id="life-is-strange-the-mechanics-of-choice"><strong><u>Life is
            Strange — The Mechanics of Choice</u></strong></h2>
            <h3 id="what-is-in-a-choice"><strong>What is in a choice?</strong> </h3>
            <p>Before we explore any further, it is imperative first to understand
            what constitutes a choice — at its core, it consists of two choices: two
            mutually exclusive continuations stemming from the same “nodal
            situation.” The term nodal situation comes from the narrative researcher
            Christopher Bode’s formalization of <em>non-unilinear</em> narratives
            called “<em><strong>Future Narratives</strong></em>,” where “The
            fundamental idea of ‘<em>Narrating Futures</em>’ is a straightforward
            one: as a rule, narratives have events as their minimal units.
            Nevertheless, there is a certain, hitherto undiscovered corpus of
            narratives that have, in addition to events, one special feature, indeed
            differentia specifica, that other narratives don’t have: they have
            nodes. A node is a situation that allows for more than one continuation”
            (7). To simplify, we might say that future narratives are the kinds of
            narratives that, at their most basic level, have the underlying unit of
            a “<em>nodal situation</em>” as their minimal unit of interactivity. The
            notion that “every ‘<em><strong>now</strong></em>’ contains a multitude
            of possible continuations” (Bode, 1; Ch. 1). These are narratives that
            give its consumer the capacity to influence the direction it takes with
            the narrative branching out (or in) — the consumer’s experience depends
            on their choices, which are influenced by their identities, values, and
            motivations. Key distinctions include the various categorizations of
            narratives predicated on the structure of their storylines —
            <em><strong>linear</strong></em>,
            <em><strong>multi-linear</strong></em>, and
            <em><strong>non-linear</strong></em> storylines — that is to say, it is
            not necessary if a narrative is <em><strong>non-unilinear</strong></em>,
            then it has to be <em><strong>non-linear</strong></em> as well.</p>
            <p>Under such a foundation wherein each branching continuation is
            mutually exclusive, it comes naturally that the “player will be
            interested in the outcome of the choice and will expect one outcome to
            be better than another” (Sebastian Domsch. 113; Ch. 5).</p>
            <p>To talk about the mechanics of “Life is Strange” (Dontnod
            Entertainment, 2016) as an interactive choice-based game, The aspect
            that the player/consumer of the media tries that their choice leads them
            to the continuation which is more favorable to them, being doubly as
            applicable to the <em>gamer</em> demographic where — It is part of the
            culture: with systemic incentives such as achievements and
            “gamer-scores,” for gamers, perfection is everything. Thus, it is only
            because of this culture that concepts such as save-scumming and players
            looking up walkthroughs to 100% completion runs exist. The game marries
            together its story and its mechanics to bring forth diegesis wherein —
            The narrative only makes sense through the employment of its core
            mechanic, and the core mechanic only exists within the context of the
            game’s narrative. Both aspects of the game exist to balance each
            other.</p>
            <p>In a brilliant move by Dontnod Entertainment, “Life is Strange”
            (2016) brilliantly subverts this cultural practice by integrating the
            process of deliberation — of which continuation does the player consider
            to be the best out of all the potential continuations offered at a given
            nodal situation — into the core mechanics itself. Furthermore, the game
            frequently auto-saving prevents the player from returning to a previous
            situation after finalizing a choice. The anatomy of choice in “Life is
            Strange” (Dontnod Entertainment, 2016), in terms of a formal
            representation, offers a non-linear storyline where each nodal situation
            exists as a <em><strong>superposition</strong></em> of each of the
            choices/branches in its possibility space. Such a nodal situation may be
            described as consisting of: (a.) A point of entry where the player has
            the choice to either go back to the previous node or pick from a given
            set of predetermined choices; (b.) The constituent choices themselves;
            and finally, (c.) A point of <em>finalization</em> — this would be the
            point at which the selected choice can no longer be changed or altered.
            Such a definition also allows for the storyline to have embedded
            narratives recursively.</p>

            <p>Though, this still does not answer the question: What is in a choice?
            The choice is something that is inherently “subjective” and “personal.”
            How does one translate something such as that to a medium wherein
            everything is, for the most part, predetermined? One aspect of at least
            achieving the appearance of choice comes from how the player has
            information — reasonable information such as context surrounding the
            choice and the characters showing how the protagonist came about
            choosing can help bridge the gap between reality and the fiction that
            the game provides. In the fourth chapter of episode-1: Chrysalis, we as
            players encounter a scene where Chloe has an altercation with her
            stepfather, David. There are a few ways in which it can play out: Let us
            examine the different ways in which it does:</p>
            <p><u>Pretext:</u> Max and Chloe are in Chloe’s room. Chloe has stolen
            David’s gun.</p>
            <p><u>Situation/Conundrum:</u> David is knocking at the door — Chloe
            asks Max to hide. David wants to interrogate Chloe on whether she stole
            one of his guns. Once he enters the room, he begins to shout at Chloe
            after discovering the pot in her room. Does the player step in?</p>
            <p>This choice has an essential dimension of being
            “<em><strong>temporal.</strong></em>”Choice situations can be either
            a-temporal or have a temporal dimension, which means that there might be
            a limited amount of time during which the options are available, or that
            — after a finite amount of time — not making any choices will produce an
            outcome that is different from the choice citation and that therefore
            constitutes a choice in itself” (Sebastian Domsch, 117; Ch. 5). </p>

            <h3 id="nostalgia-responsibility-and-the-theme-of-chaos"><strong>Nostalgia,
            Responsibility, and the theme of Chaos</strong> </h3>
            <p>In a game where all choices can be changed, how does one enforce the
            idea of real consequence? The game’s high school setting and the aspects
            of its characters’ rebellious nature, vibrant visuals, and nostalgic
            music contribute to the sustained suspension of disbelief. It stems from
            the game’s story-mechanics diegesis, which goes towards giving the
            player the impression that, with the protagonist having the power to
            bend time to her will, they can always rely on
            “<em><strong>time</strong></em>” — that it is going to be a good
            experience insofar that the player will not have to worry about the
            repercussions or making the “wrong” choice. The developers realize this,
            and therefore, through this organization of the nodal situations, they
            give the decision-making process an appearance of significance since
            players can see each continuation play out in real-time, but with no
            guarantee that their chosen continuation will be yield a favorable
            outcome in the long term — and when the player finds out that they
            “probably should not have done XYZ,” it will be too late. At that point,
            there would be no turning back.</p>
            <p>The notion that the play can reverse most choices will build up over
            time and inculcate into a habit through play. This notion comes to a
            screeching halt when it all comes to a head in Episode 2, during Kate’s
            suicide scene — A subversion of the gameplay so far. The game seemingly
            taunts the player along the lines of: “You thought you could abuse the
            system?” through disallowing the player to rewind time at all. The
            player is on their own now.</p>
            <p>This ties into one of the central themes of the game: The butterfly
            effect. Just how we as individuals are defined by our choices — some of
            these decisions can have very significant impacts on our lives. The
            choices we make also have the potential to impact the world around us
            significantly. This is the basis of the butterfly effect: that “a
            butterfly that beats its wings in one corner of the globe and with that
            single action changes the weather halfway across the world.” Every
            decision comes at a cost. Earlier in Episode 2, when we have a
            discussion with Kate about going to the police or gathering more proof,
            or, from the event in the diner when we get a call from Kate — the
            choices we make have deferred consequences in making it more difficult
            to save her in the rooftop scene.</p>
            <p>The real way to save Kate is not from the nodal situations and the
            decisions the player makes within them, but from the moments and
            <em>gameplay</em> between them. The player’s memory of Kate’s beliefs
            and family is what allows Max to bring her down. The concept of
            “<strong>Spatial Narrative</strong>” comes into play — the way that the
            player interacts with Kate and with the things in her surrounding and
            the engagement of the player with the <em><strong>navigable
            space</strong></em> generates a narrative unto itself — Details on a
            note, or on a letter in her book and bible that you learn of Kate’s
            life. In turn, the player is rewarded for paying attention; there is
            nothing better than to convince Kate to get back down. At that moment,
            the player’s actions have gravity.</p>
            <p>The theme of chaos and the player’s choices having severe and
            rippling effects is exemplified in Episode 3, where Max discovers that
            she can travel to the past by focusing her power on polaroids — in doing
            so, she travels to the past and saves Chloe’s father. On returning back
            to her own time, she finds that her reality has been changed completely.
            David is a bus driver. Max hangs out with the Vortex club members. Max
            goes over to Chloe’s place, and when she gets there, she discovers that
            by saving Chloe’s father, Chloe herself got in an accident.</p>
            <p>She tells Max that her respiratory system is failing and that her end
            is close — she asks Max to end her suffering. The player’s decision here
            does not affect the story in any capacity and is an isolated incident.
            However, it has a significant emotional impact on the player and gives
            them great insight into the fact that the player has to be more
            responsible in using Max’s powers and not take it for granted. The
            notion of your decisions impacts entire realities that could have been —
            now gone, never having even existed.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Catharsis comes from the conflict between the protagonist and the
            antagonist, but in the case of “Life is Strange” (Dontnod Entertainment,
            2016), the role of the antagonist is shrouded in uncertainty. It is not
            necessarily Jefferson, but rather, the world itself. The world —
            rebelling against the player and the player’s actions. As the player,
            you have repeatedly meddled with the natural flow of time, breaking
            apart the fabric of reality itself. In hindsight, the euthanasia
            embedded-narrative only primes the player up to understand that — Life
            is Stange as a game is about sacrifice — that nothing comes without a
            cost. Ultimately, the decision falls into the hands of the player: who
            pays the price? Furthermore, the player’s choice to sacrifice the one
            person they went through so much to save — The conundrum of agency &amp;
            accountability. The player has already seen how much of a different
            reality Chloe can exist in; many have also already killed her once: and
            it is not just that — It is that we eradicated even the possibility of
            her existence. Moreover, to be placed in a situation where the choice is
            only binary: Does the player choose Chloe, or does the player choose
            Arcadia Bay and the many people that call it home? A twisted catharsis.
            There are no perfect choices — in a game where the player, time and
            again, sought to do that which made the most sense, now faces an
            impossible choice. Then again, you may also argue that the antagonist,
            in totality, is left up to the player’s interpretation of the game’s
            story.</p>
            <p>The choices were already laid out, they always have been, but if the
            game can grip the player enough that they are in a state of suspension
            of disbelief — the predetermined nature of these choices fades into the
            background, and all that remains is you — you, the protagonist as a
            vessel for you to vicariously live through—that, and the conundrum that
            lies ahead, and all the moral connotations it carries.</p>
            <p>To treat morality as being about saving yourself. To treat the
            real-world value of your actions as less important than what these
            things say about and what you meant to do. For someone that was we have
            been desperately trying to save and go through so much for — even going
            so far as to perform, or at least, entertain the idea of euthanasia
            even; and what for? It all comes to a head— what is it that we do?</p>

            — The Illusory Nature of Choice and Authorship</u></strong></h2>
            <p>Shifting our perspective from “Life is Strange” (Dontnod
            Entertainment, 2016), a non-linear game, to “Firewatch” (Campo Santo,
            2016), a linear game. Both of these games, still revolving around the
            central theme of choice: implement their method of allowing the player
            to participate in the events very differently. In “Life is Strange”
            (Dontnod Entertainment, 2016), at each nodal situation, the player is
            presented with a set of choices, where each choice yields a separate,
            mutually exclusive continuation. “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016), on the
            other hand, offers a linear storyline.</p>
            <p>The plot follows Henry, a 39-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, whose
            wife, Julia, unfortunately, has Alzheimer's disease. To escape this,
            Henry takes up a position as a Firewatch park ranger at the Shoshone
            National Forest and is then stationed at the Two Forks Lookout.</p>
            <p>Throughout the game, Henry is presented with opportunities to engage
            in dialogue with Delilah, his boss. The aspect of choice comes in how
            the player has agency over what to say, if anything at all, to Delilah
            during their talks over walkie-talkies. However, the caveat stems from
            the fact that “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016) has a linear storyline and
            that all these choices offered are merely illusory. So how then, can we
            place “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016) in the context of <em>Future
            Narratives</em>?</p>
            <p>Under the conventional understanding that has been formed over the
            traversal of this paper, we have attempted to form a proper
            understanding of choice, defining them by the properties they possess
            and not by the experiences they generate. This does not take the
            subjective nature of choice into consideration — the way it affects the
            player: it doesn’t need to have a formalized differentiation that is
            always necessarily indicative of the distinction between once choice and
            another; In philosophy and certain models of psychology, the term
            “qualia” is defined as “the subjective or qualitative properties of
            experiences. What it feels like, experientially, [...] for hearing a
            musical note played by a piano and hearing the same musical note played
            by a tuba. The qualia of these experiences are what give each of them
            its characteristic ‘feel’ and also what distinguishes them from one
            another” (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Choice is subjective —
            in the sense that — communication is subjective, rooted in its
            translatory nature; We know that a choice is a choice, just by virtue of
            its <em><strong>qualia</strong></em>.</p>
            <p>.Each choice taken comes from a differing context insofar that
            between each choice, Henry, the protagonist, has a wide range of ways to
            interact with the environment. The game places authorship in the hands
            of the player — there are not any minimaps, you traverse by using your
            map and compass, and later in the game, the tracking device; the space
            is open, and so, the player can do whatever they wish within the bounds
            of the mechanics offered. The result of this is that the player is
            responsible for authoring who Henry really is — is Henry the kind of
            person who would throw the girl’s boombox into the water? Is he the kind
            of person who would collect all the beer cans littered around? As such,
            every choice made has a different meaning to the player, and therefore,
            it can be argued that the continuations originating from a choice of
            dialogue are unique and mutually exclusive. Each choice being colored in
            a different shade of grey, symbolizing the various “shades” of Henry
            that can originate from the individual choices made by the player</p>

            <br>
            <p>.<img

            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Hence, the game gives players a real and tangible feeling of their
            choices being significant through introducing many mico-decisions—the
            decision of the boombox, the beer cans, and so forth. And the only way
            to perform these micro-decisions is through interacting with the game
            world. The changes made through these small decisions are persistent —
            and thus, when they are revisited, it feels like the world of
            “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016) is a world that is <em>lived
            in</em>.</p>

            <p>Over the walkie-talkie, Delilah asks Henry for a description of how
            he looks. The way the player describes the character then comes back up
            in the ending — where there is a caricature of Henry stuck on the window
            in Delilah’s lookout.</p>
            <h3 id="the-role-of-causality-a-subversion-of-expectations"><strong>The
            Role of Causality; A Subversion of Expectations</strong></h3>
            <p>Christopher Bode, in their book “Future Narratives,” says, “Often,
            the mere indication of a temporal sequence — first this, then that — is
            enough to trigger the idea that maybe this sequence is not only a
            coincidence but that the two events are causally related” (4; Ch. 1);
            This shows the tendency of us as humans to try to
            “<em>fill-in-the-blanks</em>” to try and make sense or meaning out of
            potentially unrelated events; And so, causality and the formation of
            causal links act as an integral part of us forming emotional bonds with
            stories.</p>
            <p>“The entire point of stories is to let us experience other places and
            other lives” (Lebowitz and Klug 107; Ch. 5). Such instances where we as
            observers form connections and causal links between events tend to be
            more impactful than those given directly. One may argue that no
            predefined story or embedded narrative can compete with what the
            imagination can come up with — It is more rewarding for players to form
            their own narratives within storyworlds, through them not merely being
            an idle bystander to the happenings of the storyworld, but being an
            active and influential part of it. As Lebowitz and Klug put it, “To us,
            the place and characters have become alive and real. They’re not
            strangers on a page — they’re our friends, companions, and enemies, and
            as such, we truly care what happens to them” (107; Ch. 5).</p>
            <p>In “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016), everything you encounter within
            the story, save for the ending itself is conveyed to the player in a way
            such that they will surely form causal links between them.</p>
            <p>The player witnesses the ascent in the game’s story, and at every
            turning point, especially in the beginning parts of the story, they are
            given only shards of an embedded-narrative about a grand conspiracy and
            the responsibility of piecing them together and forming their own story
            falls on the player. The game doesn’t overtly
            <em><strong>tell</strong></em> us about the conspiracy of what’s
            happening in the forest, rather that it <em><strong>shows
            us.</strong></em> We, as Henry along with Delilah, <strong>experience
            it</strong> first-hand. And with each passing event, we are convinced of
            it more and more. We form causal links between all of these events. The
            shadowy figure the player sees in the beginning of the game, followed by
            the Two Forks Lookout being trashed, to the communications line being
            cut. Furthermore, right after, Delilah says: “He doesn’t know.”
            Something is fishy. Henry is paranoid, and our reflex as the player is
            to identify with that paranoia.</p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="./assets/images/narrative_analysis/image6.png"
            style="width:7.15104in;height:3.08328in" class ="img_center"/></p>
            <br>
            <p>On the second day, when Henry has to pass through the cave, he
            overhears Delilah talking to someone over the walkie-talkie. She says,
            “No, I do not think he has any idea. I am absolutely sure. Would you?”
            We are given no context for this — we don’t even know if it concerns us.
            However, right after, we are given the option to ask her about the call.
            In a sense, most players will want to — this is because the player forms
            causal links between the preceding events and this conversation. Was it
            related? Who was Delilah talking to? Was it the shadowy figure we saw
            earlier? Is that the same guy who cut the communications line? These
            mounting questions build within our minds: there is no impetus to them
            but our own imagination.</p>
            <p>If the player does choose to ask Delilah about the call, she is
            visibly upset about Henry invading her privacy, and the game prompts the
            player that she is annoyed.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016) has nothing to
            do with conspiracy theories; It is a game about tragedy, problems, and
            how people deal with grief, or rather, how they fail to do so. The sad
            story of a father incapable of fully accepting and moving on from the
            death of his child. By the end of the, it is abundantly clear what the
            game wants to tell us — the ending is the way it is for the express
            purpose that it is meant to be that way — it is not that the developers
            got lazy or that they did not have the time to come up with something
            better — it is that the developers wanted you to feel that way. To face
            reality and face your own problems.</p>
            <p>Thus, <strong>“<em>Firewatch”</em></strong> <em><strong>(Campo Santo,
            2016) is an exercise in the subversion of the player’s expectations.
            Henry acts as a glove for the player to fill</strong></em> — to live
            within the gameworld through him vicariously. It is an escape from
            reality.</p>
            <h3 id="tragedy-and-grief"><strong>Tragedy and Grief</strong> </h3>
            <p>The distance between us as the player, Henry, and his tragedy is
            abundantly clear right from the beginning of the game. We never even see
            Julia, and we, as the players, define Henry’s story through a literal
            fill-in-the-blanks segment at the beginning of the game. In their book
            “The Negative Trait Thesaurus- A Writer’s Guide to Character Flaws,”
            Angela Ackerman and Becca Puglisi point to the fact that “Characters are
            all about self-discovery, finding meaning, and achieving goals. They’re
            usually seeking to improve themselves in some way — at work, in personal
            relationships, spiritually, or through self-growth” (8). They point out
            that the world is filled with flawed people, and the stories we are,
            ultimately, imitations of real life. For characters, particularly
            painful events from their past inflict upon them what is called a
            character’s “<em><strong>wounds.</strong></em>” These wounds come from
            “defining emotional experience from a character’s past is so
            debilitating that they will do anything to avoid suffering the same kind
            of pain again” (Ackerman and Puglisi. 8).</p>
            <p>More importantly, flawed characters put up a facade to cover and hide
            their wounds. They construct lies within which they seek shelter, and
            these lies seemingly embed themselves into the character’s life—becoming
            an integral part of their psyche. This lie also serves as easy excuses
            to hide away their emotions — ironically, the lie that they form to help
            with their pain is the very thing that inhibits them from their personal
            growth. In “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016), our protagonist Henry has an
            initial stoic persona. The facade that he puts up, signifying that he
            does not need anyone, fades over time as he gets closer and closer to
            Delilah. Being involved in a grand conspiracy acts as a cover for him to
            let go of his inhibitions finally. In the exhilaration it provides, he
            can finally forget about his inner demons. Julia and the fact that he
            cannot stay as he is forever fade into the background — And through this
            adventure of uncovering the mystery of the forest, knowing that the only
            person who understands him is Delilah and that he can trust her, acts as
            an anchor. An anchor for him to finally let go of his pain. Furthermore,
            as we, the players, see how Henry’s relationship with Delilah grows more
            intimate over the course of this journey. Having only one person to talk
            to, only one person they can truly trust.</p>
            <p>Henry and Delilah seek comfort in each other — believing that they
            are in the midst of a grand conspiracy — pulling together bits and
            pieces of information, and conveniently letting their imaginations
            create causal links between seemingly unrelated events. The player is
            also guilty of this, just as much as the characters within the game are.
            They, too, are sucked into this microcosm of questions — questions of
            “why?” and “how?” The simple thrill of being part of something greater
            than just us as individuals and finally escaping the mundanity of life
            is too appealing of an offer to turn down. All of this, coming to a head
            with a revelation of the ugly truth of the kid, Bryan’s demise, and soon
            after that, the realization that the ominous fences, the tools and
            machinery, the tracking tool and all this time, the things we thought
            were extraordinary — we nothing but. A sad story of a father incapable
            of fully accepting and moving on from the death of his child. It is a
            rude awakening.</p>
            <p><em><strong>We had let everything we saw get to our
            imagination.</strong></em></p>
            <p>The game asks us; nay; forces us to confront the reality of things —
            that Henry cannot run away from his problems forever. “Most importantly,
            hidden behind the persona is the lie that creates the character’s flawed
            behavior and negative thinking. [...] The outer motivation is what the
            character wants to achieve, the outer conflict is the element that’s
            stopping them from attaining that goal. Put simply: the character must
            first achieve X, but Y is stopping them” (Ackerman and Puglisi, 10-11).
            In the end, through the realization that you have to face your problems.
            Henry finally attains catharsis.</p>
            
            <h1 id="conclusion"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></h1>
            <p>Choice is illusory; the actual feeling of substance and significance
            of our choices comes from handing off the authorship to the player in
            framing their own personal, memorable experiences — through the
            protagonist as a proxy for you, the player, and that you live out your
            fantasy vicariously through them. The player’s micro-decisions at each
            step — exploring the spatial narrative offered by the gameworld shape
            your experience. Ultimately, the player sees their character grow, and
            by extension, the player feels a sense of growth as well.</p>
            <p>The cases of “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016) and “Life is Strange”
            (Dontnod Entertainment, 2016) are indicative of the fact that the notion
            of “choice” does not necessarily point to every continuation from those
            choices being mutually exclusive. All that is genuinely required to
            leave a lasting impression on players is that they feel a sense of
            connection with the storyworld and its characters and that their
            individual choices, regardless of whether or not they result in
            significant changes to the storyline, must
            <strong><em>feel</em></strong> like they are valued, and that their
            choices are not arbitrary. This is exemplified through the fact that
            “Firewatch” (Campo Santo, 2016) is a linear game, and “Life is Strange”
            (Dontnod Entertainment, 2016) offers players only a binary choice that
            is supposed to be the accumulation of all of their choices until the
            end. Nevertheless, they are able to have a significant emotional impact
            on their players, and that is something to learn from.</p>
