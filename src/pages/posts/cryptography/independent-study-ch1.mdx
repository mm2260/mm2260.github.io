<Post title='Lattices, Probabalistic Encryption, and the NTRU Problem' date='February 1, 2023' category='Cryptography'>
---


* [1] **Introduction:**

Lattices are of special importance the world of cryptography, 
especially so lately with the push towards quantum-resistant cryptography and privacy-preserving computation. 
They offer a number of advantages over other algebraic structures, making them an attractive choice for building cryptographic primitives. 
In this post, we'll take a closer look at lattices, trapdoors, and probabilistic encryption in the context of the NTRU problem. 
We'll see how these techniques can be used to construct efficient and secure cryptosystems with the hope that this will provide 
some insights into the difficulty of the NTRU problem and the importance of continued research in this area.

Let <Math body="\mathcal{B} = \{b_1,b_2,\dots,b_k\}"/> be linearly independent vectors in <Math body="\mathbb{R}^{m}"/>, the lattice \\(L\\) generated by them is:

<Math body='\boxed{L(\mathcal{B})= \{a_1b_1+a_2b_2+\dots+a_kb_k \mid a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k \in \mathbb{Z}\}}'/>

<Math body='\mathcal{B}'/> is called the basis of the lattice \\(L\\).
